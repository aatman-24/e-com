Merger of Top and Bottom Set


Create a realistic and natural-looking e-commerce catalog image by combining the given two images — one showing a top wear and the other showing a bottom wear.

The final image should seamlessly merge them into a complete outfit worn by a child model (5–15 years old) in a studio photoshoot setting.

Ensure that:

Lighting, shadows, and proportions match naturally between the top and bottom pieces.

The outfit looks like a real, single clothing set, properly aligned and well-fitted.

Background is a clean, professional, light studio background (white or soft beige).

Focus remains on the outfit for online catalog use.

Colors and textures stay true to the original fabrics of both images.

The result should be high-resolution, photorealistic, and ready for e-commerce display.
