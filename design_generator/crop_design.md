I have a kidswear design image taken from the internet. Please crop the design part cleanly, remove any background or extra elements, and enhance the image to make it high-resolution and print-ready for fabric printing. Maintain the original design’s clarity, colors, and proportions. The output should be a transparent PNG with no background.

Also prepare a version where this cropped design is realistically applied onto my kidswear model image to visualize how it will look on clothing.
