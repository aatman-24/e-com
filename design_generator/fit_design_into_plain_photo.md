I have two input images — one of a plain kidswear outfit (top and bottom without any print), and one of a design/illustration. Please apply the design naturally onto the clothing in the first image, keeping correct proportions and placement so it looks realistically printed on the fabric.

Ensure the design fits in the best ratio (not stretched or warped), follows the fabric shape and folds, and blends with the texture so it appears like a real printed outfit photo.

Maintain the original lighting and shadows of the outfit image. The final result should look like a professional kidswear catalog photo with the design seamlessly integrated.
