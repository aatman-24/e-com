You are given a plain product image of a kidswear set (top and bottom). You also have a color reference provided through either a color image, a color code (e.g., #F5CBA7), or a color name (e.g., Peach, Sky Blue, etc.).
Your task is to:
Change only the color of the top and bottom as per the specified inputs.
Preserve all other details such as texture, stitching, shadows, folds, lighting, and realism.
Do not modify the design, shape, or background.
Ensure the recolored outfit looks natural, like a professionally shot catalog image.
Apply the color exactly as per the provided data:

Example Input:
Base Image: Plain kidswear set photo (top + bottom)
Top Color: #F2B5A7 (Peach)
Bottom Color: #A3D3F3 (Sky Blue)

Expected Output:
A realistic catalog image of the same kidswear set where only the top is recolored to Peach and the bottom to Sky Blue, keeping all textures, lighting, and shadows natural.
