Replace the background of this image with a clean, professional catalog-style studio backdrop. Keep the t-shirt and bottom set completely unchanged, fully visible, and well-lit. Use a neutral, white, or soft pastel background with minimalistic or subtle gradient texture suitable for e-commerce display. Ensure the outfit remains the focus, and the final image looks bright, polished, and professional for online catalog presentation.
